DESCRIPTION               = "This data product is a shape map (radius)
   of the Moon at a resolution of 20m/pix by 20m/pix, true at the
   pole in polar stereographic (spherical) projection, based on altimetry 
   data acquired by the LOLA instrument.  The LOLA Laser 1 and 2 adjusted
   data through mission phase LRO_ES_54 are the source for this data set. The
   The RDRs from which these products are created are consistent with the
   GRAIL 900C primary field.  Ground returns have been compared, where
   there is overlap, during some Extended Science Mission phases, to SELENE's
   Terrain Camera data.  Map values are relative to a radius of 1737.4 km.

   Individual points have been compared to a filtered dataset and about
   0.004% of the data have been flagged as erroneous, improving the quality
   over previous releases.

   This label describes two objects.  The first is a JP2 file of
   the corresponding uncompressed .IMG file.  A jpeg 2000 compression
   is used to render the image.  The second is an auxiliary xml file
   that contains extensible markup language that is interpreted by
   GDAL readers (www.gdal.org).
